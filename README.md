# Python-Machine-Learning-Project-1
Two tasks set in my Machine Learning module, one to solve a polynomial regression and another performing clustering analysis over some data

The project themselves were written using spyder(python 3.7) so would recommend to open using that program

Task 1:
In this task we have to solve a polynomial regression example. Download the dataset
pol_regression.zip. It contains a simple 1-dimensional dataset with inputs x (1 input dimension) and
output y (1 output dimension). The dataset has been generated from an unknown polynomial function
plus an additional noise term. In this task, we want to analyse the performance of polynomial
regression and use it to estimate the degree of the polynomial as well as the parameters. To achieve
the task, you will need to implement polynomial regression and evaluate its performance on the
training as well on an independent test set. You will also have to analyse these performance metrics
and discuss the relation of the degree of the polynomial to over- and underfitting.

Task 2:
In this task, several data for specific dog breeds have been collected. The data include four features,
which are height, tail length, leg length, and nose circumference for each dog breed. The purpose of
this experiment is to figure out whether these features could be used to cluster the dog breeds into
three groups/clusters. Therefore, you are asked to make a clustering analysis over the data, which
will help the animal scientists to understand their experimental results. 

A report for talking about both tasks for this project has been made under the name "Project Report for Task 1 and Task 2.pdf"
